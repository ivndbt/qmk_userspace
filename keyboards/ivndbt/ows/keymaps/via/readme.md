# OWS usage with VIA

OWS is meant to be use with [Plover](https://opensteno.org/plover/) via the GeminiPR steno protocol.\
To get started, make sure to follow the setup guide described in the [Plover Wiki](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Setting_up_a_hobbyist_writer_with_Plover) for hobbyist writers.

Compatibility with VIA is provided to simplify key customization on the additional layers beyond the default Plover layout. **Editing the base layer through VIA is not recommended**, as doing so may prevent you from reassigning the dedicated Plover keycodes without reflashing the firmware using QMK.

For an in-depth look at its features, please visit the [project repository](https://github.com/ivndbt/obiwanstenobit).
